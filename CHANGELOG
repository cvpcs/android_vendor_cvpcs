    Updated build fingerprint to 2.2 [cvpcs]

    New kernels courtesy of P3Droid [p3droid]
        p3droid has graciously made a slough of fresh froyo kernels for use
        with sapphire!  they include compcache support, squashfs, cifs, nfs,
        and many other features that will be utilized in the future.

    Modified scriptybox [cvpcs]
        Modified rmapk:
            added ability to remove ChromeToPhone and Tips

        motorola.  Thanks to P3Droid for the leak!

        NOTE: compcache support is not yet enabled in the kernel, so although
        the executable is there, unless you load a new kernel with compcache
        support.  Expect support in the next kernel.

    Fixed a control race condition for bluetooth [cyanogen]
