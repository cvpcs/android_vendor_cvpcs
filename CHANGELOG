1.0.4:
    Added new, custom kernels, for RUBY [cvpcs]
        Added some new kernels for ruby so that touch events will once
        again register.  Thanks to koush/cyanogen for the tip on the
        touch event config.

    Other tweaks:
        New (less ugly) boot animation for Ruby [cvpcs]

1.0.3:
    Upgraded to new leak proprietaries [p3droid]
        P3Droid recently released the new proprietaries for the FRG22D
        build, which have now been included into the release.

    Consolidated build [cvpcs (modifications)]
                       [cyanogen (base idea)]
        In order to better allow for multiple device support, the build
        configs are now consolidated across all devices.  This means
        a more common experience for all systems running a GEM.

1.0.2:
    New kernels [cvpcs]
        Added some new kernels with interactive governor support, which
        provides a tradeoff between battery life and performance that
        leans more towards performance.  Note that ondemand will remain
        the default as it promotes better battery life.  The stock
        125-1000LV kernel has also been replaced by the 250-800SV kernel
        for the purpose of providing more stability out-of-the-box.

    Various fixes:
        Fixed FC with GEM Settings/DSP Manager [cvpcs]
        More tweaks to the volume button music controls [cvpcs]

1.0.1:
    Added rsync [dylex]
        As per a request I have added the rsync binary for those who
        would use it to sync data between their phones and various other
        sources.

    Removed ChromeToPhone [cvpcs]
        As ChromeToPhone is now in market, there is no need to include
        it here.

    Added VolBtn Music Control Enable option to GEM [cvpcs]
        Added an option in GEM Settings to enable/disable the volume
        button music controls.

    Added Audio DSP settings [alankila]
        Alankila did some awesome things with Audio Digital Signal
        Processing, which have now been incorporated into GEM Settings.

    Re-enabled stagefright player [cvpcs] (thanks google)
        A recent check-in to the froyo source tree has fixed the audio
        issues some were experiencing in stagefright, specifically with
        AAC+ and eAAC streams.  Thus I have synced the fix and re-
	enabled stagefright for media playback.

1.0.0:
    Modified scriptybox [cvpcs]
        Changed where scriptybox retrieves its files url for switchapk

    Disabled stagefright player [cvpcs]
        The stagefright player has been disabled in favor of the opencore
        one.  This is likely to change in the future and was only done as
        some users have reported poor audio quality on some applications
        using stagefright.

    Updated latest sholes kernels [cvpcs]
        Added IPv6 support to the base kernel instead of a module.  This
        fixes a few FC in applications like Google Goggles which try to
        use IPv6.

    Modified next/prev volume button controls [cvpcs]
        Fixed some logic in the longpress issues where presses were being
        sent indefinitely.  Also doubled the amount of time for repeated
        longpresses for easier track seeking.

    Other tweaks:
        Added warning to Performance settings if cpu min > max [cvpcs]

0.9.6:
    Modified next/prev volume button controls [cvpcs]
        Now if you longpress and hold the up/down volume buttons, it will
        seek through tracks instead of executing once and then raising or
        lowering the volume

    Added Lockscreen Music [kmobs]
        Provides lockscreen music controls (play/pause/next/previous)
        based on kmob's original work

    Added CPUFreq options to boot [cvpcs]
        CPUFreq will now be enabled based on the settings in GEM settings
        at boot time

        Fixed wifi proprietaries issue [cvpcs]

0.9.5:
    Updated sapphire kernels [cvpcs]
        Made some fixes to the sapphire kernels to fix the omap34xx cpu
        temp sensor, as well as a camera issue.  This update to the kernel
        also fixed the battery use issue where battery usage for non-system
        apps would not show up under phone info.

    Changes to GEM Settings [cvpcs]
        Added options to GEM settings to set cpu frequency scaling options
        (i.e. governor, min/max speeds, etc) at boot-time

    Bug fixes:
        50% signal loss bug [koush]

0.9.4:
    Updated to custom sapphire kernels [cvpcs]
        For various reasons, sapphire kernels will be customized by myself
        (cvpcs) from here on out.  The new kernels are based on P3Droid's
        original work for sapphire, with overclocking info borrowed from
        Bekit's work

    Reverted to Stock apps by default [cvpcs]
        After much consideration, I have reverted the defaults for sapphire
        apps to those which are stock (this includes Music, Launcher2, etc).
        There are many reasons for this, but all custom apps such as
        ADW, EliotStocker, and Cytown, will remain available through the
        switchapk script in scriptybox

    Other tweaks:
        Fixed problem with ##PROGRAM menu [cvpcs]

        default and must be installed separately

        will believe Sapphire is a standard verizon release

    Added ability to see MOD/ROM version in Settings [cvpcs]
        This allows for the phone to better mimick verizon's releases, as the
        Sapphire version is no longer stored in build.display.id

0.8.2:
    Removed native IM app [cvpcs]
        The interface that the native IM app uses has been removed from android
        causing the app to force-close indefinitely.  For this reason, this app
        has been removed from sapphire.

        and placed in libstagefright

    Added GEM Settings app [cvpcs]
        Removes the need to modify the development portion of AOSP.  All
        sapphire-specific settings will be held in this app now.  All color
        settings have been moved from spare parts to this app.

    Added battery percentage overlay [cvpcs (minor rework)]
                                     [cyanogen (base)]
        Optional text display over the battery icon that notifies of the
        percentage of battery life remaining.  This display can be turned off
        in spare parts.  It also does not display if plugged in or at 100%.

    Custom-built kernels [p3droid]
        P3Droid has custom-built some kernels for sapphire!  Thanks goes out

        Long-pressing the camera button play/pauses tracks

0.6.2:
    Re-added compcache executable
        NOTE: compcache support is not yet enabled in the kernel, so although
        the executable is there, unless you load a new kernel with compcache
        support.  Expect support in the next kernel.

    Fixed a control race condition for bluetooth [cyanogen]
        There was a race condition that would cause connections to fail for
