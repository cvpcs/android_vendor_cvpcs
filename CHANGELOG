2.0.2 [HEAD]:
    Fixed compcache detection in GEMSettings [cvpcs]
        Compcache is now detected by the presence of its kernel module
        as well as swap support.  This ensures that a system with swap
        support but no compcache module doesn't falsly get detected
        as having support.

2.0.1:
    Moved boot/recovery update packages (Obsidian/Tanzanite) [cvpcs]
        The boot package for obsidian and tanzanite has been moved
        to /system and the custom recovery has been removed in favor
        of utilizing koush's bootstrap recovery.  This will allow users
        to make complete nandroid flashes back and forth between
        obsidian/tanzanite and other roms.

    Bugfixes:
        An ACTUAL  fix for battery drain/performance on DX
                                           (Obsidian/Tanzanite) [cvpcs]
        Fix a bug related to cwiid starting (Obsidian/Tanzanite) [cvpcs]

2.0.0:
    Added simple Matroska container support [aosp]
        Pulled in support for the Matroska media container from gingerbread.
        This is somewhat buggy and will need to be worked on.

    Removed all market apps from the build [cvpcs]
        All market apps have been removed in favor of downloading them from
        the market (ADW, Musicmod, Gmail, GoogleMaps, etc).  The reason for
        this is to promote stability by reducing issues updating these apps.
        For apps that were once available in scriptybox, they have been removed
        from the switchapk script pending a more stable method of replacing
        system apps (which will be included later)

    Bugfixes:
        Fixed search button issue with google search from market [cvpcs]
        Fixed music continuous skip (hopefully?) [cvpcs]
        Fixed a problem with longpress back kill dialog [cvpcs]
        Working usb for DX/D2 (Obsidian/Tanzanite) [cvpcs]
        Fixed battery drain on DX/D2 (Obsidian/Tanzanite) [cvpcs] 
        Improved performance on the DX/D2 (Obsidian/Tanzanite) [cvpcs]

1.1.8:
    Longpress BACK kills current process [evan charlton/cvpcs]
        If users opt-in, long-pressing BACK will kill the current
        foreground process.  This setting can be modified in GEM
        Settings.

    New AppWidgetPicker [boombuler]
        Groups widgets by package when selecting which ones to
        place on the home screen.

    Added MIUI RIL for Incredible [cvpcs] (Ruby)
        The HTC RIL that was hacked by the MIUI group is now baked
        into the HTC Droid Incredible Ruby ROM (no more need to patch
        it)

    Working, simple push notifications [cvpcs]
        Push notifications are now working in a usable sense.  At
        this point, however, they are exteremely simplistic.  They
        will simply be used to notify users the moment an update
        or patch is available, and clicking on the notification
        simply opens a page in the browser to more information.
        The app will be extended in the future to become more
        robust.  Push notifications were also moved into GEM Settings
        so as not to clutter the launcher.

    Bugfixes:
        Fixed some problems with volume mounting [cuviper]

1.1.7:
    New EVO kernels [cvpcs] (Emerald)
        Updated the supersonic (HTC Evo 4G) kernels to work with

        updates as soon as they come out using Google's cloud-to-
        device messaging system.  (NOTE: this feature is purely
        opt-in)

        Audio from source [cvpcs] (Obsidian)

1.1.5:
    Added GEM system user [cvpcs]
        Instead of running low-level system apps as the uber-powerful,
        all-knowing SYSTEM... (que TRON music here) ... I have opted to
        create a less powerful (but still equally epic) user named "gem"
        which only has access to what is required to run custom system
        apps such as GEMSettings and CWiiDConfig

    Reverted to 2.1 volume rocker behavior [erasmux]
        Reverted to the original 2.1 volume rocker behavior that will
        go from sound -> vibrate -> silent when using the volume rocker

    Updated AOSP Froyo [cvpcs]
        Once again merged AOSP froyo's recent changes

    Added CWiiD WiiMote Connectivity [cvpcs/nehresmann]
        CWiiD is a library that enabled wiimotes to connect via
        bluetooth to your device.  They can then be used as remote
        controls or as a virtual keyboard.

1.1.4:
    Updated to AOSP Froyo 2.2.1 [cvpcs]
        AOSP recently pushed a group of updates corresponding to a new
        froyo release (2.2.1), which have now been incorporated into
        the build.

1.1.3:
    Moved Obsidian to a chroot environment [cvpcs] (Obsidian)
        Obsidian is now inside a jailed root environment (chroot), which
        allows it to remain distinct and oblivious to the motorola init
        that spawns it. (huzzah!)

    Bug fixes:
        Battery daemon now starts properly on boot [cvpcs] (Obsidian)
        Wifi works! [cvpcs] (Obsidian)
        Bluetooth works! [cvpcs] (Obsidian)

1.1.2:
    First functional build of Obsidian [cvpcs] (Obsidian)
        This build marks the first properly booting release of
        Obsidian (AOSP for Droid X), however there are still MANY bugs
        some of which are critical (i.e. audio doesn't work), which
        need to be worked out.

    Added rotary lockscreen [cvpcs]
        Through gem settings you can now choose to replace the default
        tab lockscreen with a rotary one

        Added the new boot animations from Luda for the emerald and
        obsidian builds

    Added Bluetooth MAC settings [koush] (Ruby)

    Scan all mounted directories for Media [koush]
        Added the ability to scan all of the mounted directories for
        media.  This allows internal and external storage on some
        devices to have their media show up in Gallery/Music/etc.

1.1.0:
    New boot animations [Ludacrosse05]
        Luda has been nice enough to make some truly kick-ass boot

        I have incorporated some of koush's source for his hijack script
        for devices that don't support an unlocked bootloader.

    Added Emerald (HTC Evo/Supersonic) build [cvpcs]
        Added a vendor setup for the HTC Evo to begin some work on that
        as well, being it has similar hardware to the Incredible.

    Added custom kernel for Emerald [cvpcs]

        build, which have now been included into the release.

    Consolidated build [cvpcs (modifications)]
                       [cyanogen (base idea)]
        In order to better allow for multiple device support, the build
        configs are now consolidated across all devices.  This means
        a more common experience for all systems running a GEM.

1.0.2:
    New kernels [cvpcs]
        Added some new kernels with interactive governor support, which
        provides a tradeoff between battery life and performance that
        leans more towards performance.  Note that ondemand will remain
        the default as it promotes better battery life.  The stock
        125-1000LV kernel has also been replaced by the 250-800SV kernel
        for the purpose of providing more stability out-of-the-box.

        Processing, which have now been incorporated into GEM Settings.

    Re-enabled stagefright player [cvpcs] (thanks google)
        A recent check-in to the froyo source tree has fixed the audio
        issues some were experiencing in stagefright, specifically with
        AAC+ and eAAC streams.  Thus I have synced the fix and re-
	enabled stagefright for media playback.

1.0.0:
    Modified scriptybox [cvpcs]
        Changed where scriptybox retrieves its files url for switchapk

    Disabled stagefright player [cvpcs]
        The stagefright player has been disabled in favor of the opencore
        one.  This is likely to change in the future and was only done as
        some users have reported poor audio quality on some applications
        using stagefright.

    Updated latest sholes kernels [cvpcs]
        Added IPv6 support to the base kernel instead of a module.  This
        fixes a few FC in applications like Google Goggles which try to
        use IPv6.

    Modified next/prev volume button controls [cvpcs]
        Fixed some logic in the longpress issues where presses were being

    Other tweaks:
        Added warning to Performance settings if cpu min > max [cvpcs]

0.9.6:
    Modified next/prev volume button controls [cvpcs]
        Now if you longpress and hold the up/down volume buttons, it will
        seek through tracks instead of executing once and then raising or
        lowering the volume

    Added Lockscreen Music [kmobs]
        Provides lockscreen music controls (play/pause/next/previous)
        based on kmob's original work

    Added CPUFreq options to boot [cvpcs]
        CPUFreq will now be enabled based on the settings in GEM settings

0.9.5:
    Updated sapphire kernels [cvpcs]
        Made some fixes to the sapphire kernels to fix the omap34xx cpu
        temp sensor, as well as a camera issue.  This update to the kernel
        also fixed the battery use issue where battery usage for non-system
        apps would not show up under phone info.

    Changes to GEM Settings [cvpcs]
        Added options to GEM settings to set cpu frequency scaling options
        (i.e. governor, min/max speeds, etc) at boot-time

        50% signal loss bug [koush]

0.9.4:
    Updated to custom sapphire kernels [cvpcs]
        For various reasons, sapphire kernels will be customized by myself
        (cvpcs) from here on out.  The new kernels are based on P3Droid's
        original work for sapphire, with overclocking info borrowed from
        Bekit's work

    Reverted to Stock apps by default [cvpcs]
        After much consideration, I have reverted the defaults for sapphire
        apps to those which are stock (this includes Music, Launcher2, etc).
        There are many reasons for this, but all custom apps such as
        ADW, EliotStocker, and Cytown, will remain available through the
        switchapk script in scriptybox

    Other tweaks:
        Fixed problem with ##PROGRAM menu [cvpcs]

        Allows you to enable compcache via the GEM Settings app, and have the
        setting persist through reboots

    Removed google apps by default [cvpcs]
        For legal reasons, google apps have been removed from sapphire by
        default and must be installed separately

        Changed the build prop overrides to match that of FRF84B so that market
        will believe Sapphire is a standard verizon release

    Added ability to see MOD/ROM version in Settings [cvpcs]
        This allows for the phone to better mimick verizon's releases, as the
        Sapphire version is no longer stored in build.display.id

0.8.2:
    Removed native IM app [cvpcs]
        The interface that the native IM app uses has been removed from android
        causing the app to force-close indefinitely.  For this reason, this app
        has been removed from sapphire.

        Changed vendor setups to support multiple hardware in the future

0.8.0:

        and placed in libstagefright

    Added GEM Settings app [cvpcs]
        Removes the need to modify the development portion of AOSP.  All
        sapphire-specific settings will be held in this app now.  All color

                                     [cyanogen (base)]
        Optional text display over the battery icon that notifies of the
        percentage of battery life remaining.  This display can be turned off
        in spare parts.  It also does not display if plugged in or at 100%.

    Custom-built kernels [p3droid]
        P3Droid has custom-built some kernels for sapphire!  Thanks goes out
        to him for all the hard work.  These new kernels now provide several
        missing modules such as compcache and cifs and more.

        Added ability to shut off USB Debugging notification [cvpcs]
        Added ability to remove status bar clock [cvpcs]

                                                          [cyanogen (vol)]
        Long-pressing the volume up/down buttons changes tracks
        Long-pressing the camera button play/pauses tracks

0.6.2:
    Re-added compcache executable
        NOTE: compcache support is not yet enabled in the kernel, so although
        the executable is there, unless you load a new kernel with compcache
        support.  Expect support in the next kernel.

    Fixed a control race condition for bluetooth [cyanogen]
        There was a race condition that would cause connections to fail for

                                      [cyanogen (base work and commit)]
        provides a method to set the various text colors in the notifcation and
        status bars

    Modified scriptybox [cvpcs]

                included in scriptybox, without actually running those commands
        modified commands:
            {all}
                all commands were updated so that if you run them as:
                  [command] --help
                they will be guaranteed to print out their usage information

    Added command line knock executable [cvpcs]
