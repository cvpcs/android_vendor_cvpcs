This file is a listing of all APK and JAR files that have changed between
each version of the GEM series.  It is intended primarily as a guide to 
themers of what files need to be re-made when up-porting to the latest
release.  The format is as follows:

[oldversion] to [newversion]:
	[file path] [description of what happened file-wise
                     (think created/renamed/etc)]

I hope this helps the themers out!
